## Idea

I was inspired by video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCwMb0KslX8 where author makes a snake game using 
[Piston](https://www.piston.rs/). I decided to get same result with [Amethyst](https://amethyst.rs) -- it was second in a list ;)

## Quickstart
* Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jonyrock/snake-game
cd snake-game
```

* Build and run the project
```bash
cargo run
```

## Links & Learning tips
I learned how to do things by wathing / reading links in this order:
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCwMb0KslX8 -- motivation video
* http://arewegameyet.com/#games -- more motivation :)
* https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst/blob/v0.12.0/examples/pong_tutorial_01/main.rs -- take a loot at an amethyst piece of project
* https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst/blob/v0.12.0/examples/hello_world/main.rs -- try to compile this first (when `Cargo.toml` is ready)
