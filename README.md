## Idea

I was inspired by video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCwMb0KslX8 where authors makes a snake game using 
[Piston](https://www.piston.rs/). I decided to get same result with [Amethyst](https://amethyst.rs) -- it was second in a list ;)

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jonyrock/snake-game
cd snake-game
```

* Build and run the project
```bash
